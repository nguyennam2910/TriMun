\section{Accomplishments}
    % This thesis has presented a novel framework for human action recognition.
    This thesis has proposed a novel multi-view discriminant analysis technique and successfully integrated it in a framework for multi-view human action and gesture recognition.
    The framework integrates various successful deep features with multi-view discriminant analysis to deal with cross-view human action recognition.
    In particular, five deep models have been utilized: ResNet with three pooling techniques; ResNet-3D and C3D.
    These deep features have been universally used for action recognition from a common view but rarely utilized for evaluating cross-view HAR.
    Besides, three variations of multi-view discriminant analysis: the original MvDA, MvDA with view consistency (MvDA-vc) and our proposed pairwise-covariance MvDA (pc-MvDA) have been investigated.
    Multi-view analysis algorithms have been successfully deployed for cross-view recognition of static images but never applied for spatio-temporal features.
    The experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieved highest average accuracy of 84.79\% (5.29\% higher than MvDA and 1.21\% higher than MvDA-vc).
    % In addition, ResNet-50 3D gives the best overall HAR accuracy for both cross-view and multi-view evaluation protocols.
    % It concludes that the combination of deep features with pc-MvDA is suitable and feasible to deploy the proposed framework in practical applications.
