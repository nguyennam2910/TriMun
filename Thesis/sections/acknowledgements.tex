This thesis would not have been possible without the help of many people.
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to my primary advisor, Prof. Tran Thi Thanh Hai, who guided me throughout this project.
I would like to thank Prof. Le Thi Lan and Prof. Vu Hai for giving me deep insight, valuable recommendations and brilliant idea.

I am grateful for my time spent at MICA International Research Institute, where I learnt a lot about research and enjoyed a very warm and friendly working atmosphere.
In particular, I wish to extend my special thanks to PhD candidate. Nguyen Hong Quan and Dr. Doan Huong Giang who directly supported me.

Finally, I wish to show my appreciation to all my friends and family members who helped me finalizing the project.
